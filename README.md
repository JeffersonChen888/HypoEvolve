# AI Coscientist: Evolutionary AI for Scientific Discovery

This repository implements a genetic algorithm framework enhanced with large language models (LLMs) for automated scientific hypothesis generation and complex scientific question answering. The system uses evolutionary computation principles to iteratively refine scientific hypotheses through generation, evaluation, and evolution operations.

## Overview

My current job is to test and run the code (the repository is private and used for a research, so I only uploaded the code that I used to run and test the method).
There are multiple python file to test the LLMs api calling, that's why I wrote a few test files to testing the api calls.
