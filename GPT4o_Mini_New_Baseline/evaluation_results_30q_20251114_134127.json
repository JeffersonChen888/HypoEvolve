Fe(OH)3 is a weakly soluble compound, and to dissolve it, we need to provide enough protons (H+) from the strong acid. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 106.87 g/mol, so 0.1 g corresponds to about 0.000935 moles. To fully dissolve this, we need an equivalent amount of H+ ions. A 0.1 M solution means that 1 L contains 0.1 moles of H+, so to find the volume needed to provide 0.000935 moles, we can use the formula: Volume (L) = moles / concentration = 0.000935 moles / 0.1 M = 0.00935 L or 9.35 cm3. However, we also need to consider the final volume of the solution, which is 100 cm3.
