Question: Compound X, which has the following IR and NMR data, reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Identify the final product.
IR: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1
1H NMR: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Options:
A) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene
B) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
C) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
D) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "B",
  "Reasoning": "The IR data indicates the presence of a carboxylic acid (broad peak around 3400–2500 cm-1) and a carbonyl (1720 cm-1), which suggests that the compound is likely a benzoic acid derivative. The NMR data shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which is characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. The presence of aromatic protons at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) indicates a para-substituted benzene ring. The additional peaks in the NMR suggest the presence of a sec-butyl group, which aligns with the structure of 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI typically indicates a substitution or reduction reaction, which further supports the identification of the compound as a benzoic acid derivative."
