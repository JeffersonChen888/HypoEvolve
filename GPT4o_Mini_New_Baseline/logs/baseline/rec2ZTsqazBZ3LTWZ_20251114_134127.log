QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: You perform a high-throughput experiment on white lupine to find genes contributing to resistance to the fungal disease anthracnose. As a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, and G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, and g3, and a set of double-mutants, g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. You know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of (an)other gene(s). You start to test those mutant plants: do they have a higher sensitivity to anthracnose than the wild-type because they cannot produce certain gene products? 
After tests with the pathogen, you receive the following results where 100% is the level of resistance to the pathogen in control; 50% is half of the control’s resistance; 25% is a quarter of the control’s resistance; 0% ‒ all plants show signs of infection:
- resistance of g1: 75% of control
- resistance of g2: 0% from control
- resistance of g3: 50% from control
-resistance of g1g3: 10% from control
- resistance of g2g3: 0% from control
- resistance of g1g2: 0% from control

Which conclusion regarding those genes' interaction can you draw from this experiment?


Options:
A) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3
B) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3
C) G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 has the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1
D) G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "A",
  "Reasoning": "G2 shows a complete loss of resistance (0% from control), indicating it is likely a transcription factor essential for resistance. The g1g2 and g2g3 double mutants also show 0% resistance, suggesting that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. G1 and G3 have some level of redundancy since g1 shows 75% resistance and g3 shows 50% resistance, indicating that they can partially compensate for each other when one is knocked out."
