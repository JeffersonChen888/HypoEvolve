API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "B",
  "Reasoning": "To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we can use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant (approximately 1.055 x 10^(-34) Js). The momentum p of the electron can be expressed as p = mv, where m is the mass of the electron (approximately 9.11 x 10^(-31) kg) and v is the speed of the electron (2 x 10^8 m/s). The uncertainty in momentum Δp can be related to the uncertainty in energy ΔE using the relation ΔE = Δp * v. 

First, we calculate the momentum:
p = mv = (9.11 x 10^(-31) kg)(2 x 10^8 m/s) = 1.822 x 10^(-22) kg m/s.

Now, we can find Δp using the uncertainty principle:
Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.055 x 10^(-34) Js)/(2 * 0.1 x 10^(-9) m) = 5.275 x 10^(-25) kg m/s.

Now, we can estimate ΔE:
ΔE = Δp * v = (5.275 x 10^(-25) kg m/s)(2 x 10^8 m/s) = 1.055 x 10^(-16) J.

This value is approximately 10^(-16) J, which suggests that the closest option is B) ~10^(-17) J, as it is the only reasonable estimate given the options provided."
