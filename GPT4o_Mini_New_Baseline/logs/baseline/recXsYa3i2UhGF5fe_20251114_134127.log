API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "C",
  "Reasoning": "The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) can be calculated based on the number of rings and multiple bonds in a molecule. The reaction of 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI typically leads to the saturation of double bonds and the formation of a more saturated product. Given the structure of the starting material, the IHD is calculated to be 3, accounting for the rings and double bonds present in the original compound."
