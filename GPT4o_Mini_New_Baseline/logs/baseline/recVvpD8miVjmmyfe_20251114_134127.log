QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: You come across an algorithm that gives the following output (written as input -> output):

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

What value does ACAGTGACC give?

Options:
A) 315
B) 185
C) 333
D) 351

You must respond in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "Answer": "A or B or C or D",
  "Reasoning": "your reasoning here"
}

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "C",
  "Reasoning": "To determine the output for ACAGTGACC, we can analyze the given outputs for AGG and TGCTGA. The outputs seem to correspond to the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the input strings. For AGG, the ASCII values are A(65) + G(71) + G(71) = 207, but the output is 115, which suggests a different calculation or transformation. For TGCTGA, the ASCII values are T(84) + G(71) + C(67) + T(84) + G(71) + A(65) = 442, but the output is 176, indicating another transformation. Without a clear pattern from the provided examples, we can estimate the output for ACAGTGACC by summing the ASCII values of its characters: A(65) + C(67) + A(65) + G(71) + T(84) + G(71) + A(65) + C(67) + C(67) = 65 + 67 + 65 + 71 + 84 + 71 + 65 + 67 + 67 = 667. However, this does not match any of the options. Given the options, we can assume a consistent transformation might yield 333 as a plausible output based on the patterns observed in the previous outputs."
