QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: Consider an oscillating charge distribution, which is spheroid in shape (with the symmetry axis along z-axis). Because it oscillates, it would radiate at a wavelength \lambda. In the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle will be a function f of \lambda and the angle \theta (with z-axis), along which the power is measured. If the maximum power thus radiated is A, the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle \theta = 30^0 and a possible form of f are, respectively,

Options:
A) 3/4, \lambda^(-6)
B) 1/4, \lambda^(-4)
C) 1/4, \lambda^(-3)
D) 1/2, \lambda^(-4)

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "B",
  "Reasoning": "In the context of radiation from an oscillating charge distribution, the angular distribution of power radiated is often described by a function that depends on the angle and the wavelength. For a dipole radiation pattern, the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to sin²(θ), which leads to a maximum at θ = 90° and a minimum at θ = 0° and θ = 180°. At θ = 30°, the fraction of the maximum power A radiated is typically 1/4, and the dependence on wavelength for dipole radiation is λ^(-4). Therefore, the correct option is B) 1/4, λ^(-4)."
