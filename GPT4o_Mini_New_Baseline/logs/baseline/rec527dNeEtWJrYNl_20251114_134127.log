QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody to the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells followed by next-generation sequencing and standard quality control, alignment and peak-calling steps produced ChIP peaks that disappeared when PFA+DSG fixation was used. Where are we most likely to find such disappearing peaks?

Options:
A) At active promoters and enhancers
B) At random locations in the genome
C) At repeats
D) In the introns of large genes

You must respond in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "Answer": "A or B or C or D",
  "Reasoning": "your reasoning here"
}

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "A",
  "Reasoning": "ChIP-seq peaks that disappear with PFA+DSG fixation likely correspond to active promoters and enhancers, as these regions are typically more sensitive to cross-linking conditions. The IKAROS transcription factor is known to play a role in regulating gene expression at these sites, and the use of a stronger fixation method like DSG may disrupt the binding of the transcription factor, leading to the loss of detectable peaks."
