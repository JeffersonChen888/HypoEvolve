QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: "Scientist aims to run quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on some samples. He first wants to make a calibration curve so he took positive control with known copy numbers and run qPCR on serially diluted positive control three technical replicates. The efficiency of qPCR was 100%. The R2 was 1, and the slope was -3.3. His results were as follows:
At the concentration of 100000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 33.9, 34.2, 34.5.
At the concentration of 10000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 30.6, 30.9, 31.2.
At the concentration of 1000 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 27.3, 27.6, 27.9.
At the concentration of 100 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 24, 24.3, 24.6.
At the concentration of 10 copies per µl, ct of triplicate results were 20.7, 21, 21.3
Which of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?



Options:
A) Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in samples 
B) Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles
C) The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates
D) qPCR cannot be used for the quantification of nucleic acid in samples 

You must respond in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "Answer": "A or B or C or D",
  "Reasoning": "your reasoning here"
}

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "A",
  "Reasoning": "The Ct values obtained do not align with the expected values based on the known copy numbers, indicating that the Ct values are not in agreement with the amount of target nucleic acid in the samples. This suggests discrepancies in the results."
