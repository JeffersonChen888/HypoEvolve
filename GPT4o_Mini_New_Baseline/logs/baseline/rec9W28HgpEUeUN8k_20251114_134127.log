QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: Calculate the amount of non-Gaussianity(nG) in the Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy measure. The state is defined as,
|psi> =( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N;
Here, alpha is the amplitude, phi is the phase and N is the normalisation constant.
N = sqrt(1+ sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)).
The relative entropy measure is given as,
del_b = [trace(rho* ln(rho))-trace(tau* ln(tau))]
where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of the above non-Gaussian state.
Calculate the nG for phi =-pi /4 and alpha= 0.5.

Options:
A) 1.38
B) 0
C) 2.48
D) 0.25

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "C",
  "Reasoning": "To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure for the given Schrödinger cat state, we need to evaluate the expression for del_b using the specified values of phi and alpha. After substituting phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5 into the equations for the normalization constant N and the density matrices rho and tau, we find that the resulting value of del_b corresponds to the option C) 2.48, which indicates a significant amount of non-Gaussianity in the state."
