Question: Which of the following issues are the most common sources of difficult-to-spot erroneous results generated in genomics data analysis:

- Mutually incompatible data formats
- The "chr" / "no chr" confusion
- Reference assembly mismatch
- Incorrect ID conversion

Options:
A) 3 and 4
B) All of the above
C) 2 and 3
D) 2, 3 and 4

You must respond in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "Answer": "A or B or C or D",

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "B",
  "Reasoning": "All of the listed issues can lead to difficult-to-spot erroneous results in genomics data analysis. Mutually incompatible data formats can cause data misinterpretation, the 'chr' / 'no chr' confusion can lead to incorrect chromosome identification, reference assembly mismatch can result in alignment errors, and incorrect ID conversion can lead to mislabeling of genetic variants. Therefore, all of these issues are common sources of errors."
