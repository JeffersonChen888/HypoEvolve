QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: In an industrial research lab, a scientist performs ethylene polymerization with a homogeneous organometallic catalyst system, generating a polymer of high density. He intends to add a second catalyst system to introduce regular branches in the polymer backbone, also only using ethylene as the reactant. He consults a senior scientist, who gives the following statements. “Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US. One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators. Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step. Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.”
Which of these four statements is correct regarding the formation of a polymer with regular branches using only ethylene as the monomer and a dual catalyst system?

Options:
A) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.
B) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.
C) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.
D) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "B",
  "Reasoning": "The statement indicates that combined catalyst systems for polymerization are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US, which aligns with current practices in polymer chemistry. This suggests that the use of dual catalyst systems for modifying polymer structures is not only theoretical but also practical and established in the industry."
