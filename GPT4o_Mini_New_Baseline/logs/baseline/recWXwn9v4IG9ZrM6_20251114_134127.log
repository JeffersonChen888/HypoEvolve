QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation can be expressed as
$ J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}$
where $\epsilon$ is the dielectric constant, $\mu$ is the charge carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. Which of the following statements is true about the validity of this equation?


Options:
A) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current.
B) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current.
C) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.
D) The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "A",
  "Reasoning": "The Mott-Gurney equation is specifically derived for a trap-free single-carrier device where the current is limited by space charge effects, and it assumes no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. This makes option A the correct statement regarding the validity of the equation."
