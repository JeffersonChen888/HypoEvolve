QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1.

1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of a catalytic amount of HCl, forming product 2.

2 is treated at low temperature with n-butyllithium, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.

3 is stirred with Pd/C under a hydrogen atmosphere, forming product 4.

What is the structure of product 4?

Options:
A) (3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methanol
B) (((3-isopropylcyclohexyl)methoxy)methyl)benzene
C) 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol
D) N'-(3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-isopropylcyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonohydrazide

You must respond in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "Answer": "A or B or C or D",
  "Reasoning": "your reasoning here"
}

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "C",
  "Reasoning": "The sequence of reactions suggests that product 4 is derived from the initial compound through a series of transformations that involve the introduction of a benzyloxy group and a butyl group, followed by hydrogenation. The final product must retain the cyclohexane structure while incorporating the functional groups introduced in the previous steps, which aligns with option C, 3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-1-butyl-5-isopropylcyclohexan-1-ol."
