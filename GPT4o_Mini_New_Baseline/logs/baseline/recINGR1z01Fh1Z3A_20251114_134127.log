QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: Two stars are being studied. It has been observed that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2. In fact, the energy difference between the considered energy levels was determined to be approximately 1.38 x 10^(-23) J. Assuming that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which of these equations for the effective temperatures of the stars (T_1 and T_2) is correct?

Options:
A) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)]

B) ln(2) = [ (T_1 - T_2) / (T1*T2)^2 ]

C) ln(2) = [ (T_1 + T_2) / (T1*T2)]

D) ln(2) = [ T_2 / T_1]

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "A",
  "Reasoning": "In the context of thermal equilibrium and the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the equation: N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/kT), where g1 and g2 are the degeneracies of the energy levels, ΔE is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. Given that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2, we can set up the equation as ln(2) = (ΔE/k) * (1/T1 - 1/T2). Rearranging this leads to the form ln(2) = [(T1 - T2) / (T1*T2)], which corresponds to option A."
