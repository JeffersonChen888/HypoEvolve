QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: Substances 1-6 undergo an electrophilic substitution reaction with an excess of bromine (it is assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed):
1) С6H5-CH3
2) C6H5-COOC2H5
3) C6H5-Cl
4) C6H5-NO2
5) C6H5-C2H5
6) C6H5-COOH
C6H5 - means benzene ring
Arrange the substances in order of increasing the weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer.

Options:
A) 4<6<2<1<5<3
B) 4<2<6<3<1<5
C) 6<2<4<5<1<3
D) 3<5<1<6<2<4

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "B",
  "Reasoning": "In electrophilic substitution reactions, the position of substitution on the benzene ring is influenced by the substituents already present. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) such as -C2H5 and -CH3 direct substitution to the ortho and para positions, while electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like -NO2 and -COOH direct substitution to the meta position. The order of increasing weight fraction of the yield of the para-isomer is determined by the strength of the substituents' effects. -NO2 is a strong EWG, leading to the least para substitution, followed by -COOH, which is also an EWG but less so than -NO2. -C2H5 and -CH3 are EDGs, promoting para substitution, with -C2H5 being more effective than -CH3. -Cl is a weak EWG and directs substitution to the ortho and para positions but does not favor one over the other significantly. Thus, the correct order is 4 (NO2) < 2 (COOC2H5) < 6 (COOH) < 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)."
