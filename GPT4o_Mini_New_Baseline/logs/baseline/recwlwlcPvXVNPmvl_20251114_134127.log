QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: Consider a system of three spins S1, S2 and S3. Each of which can take spin +1 and -1. The energy of the system is given by, E= -J[ S1S2 +S1S3+S2S3 ].
Find the partition function Z of the system. (\beta = 1/kT , k= boltzmann constant and T= temperature)

Options:
A) Z= 2 e^(3J\beta)+6e^(-J\beta)
B) Z= 6e^(2J\beta)+2e^(-2J\beta)
C) Z= 2 e^(-3J\beta)+6e^(J\beta)
D) Z= 2e^(2J\beta)+6e^(-2J\beta)

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "A",
  "Reasoning": "To find the partition function Z for the system of three spins, we need to consider all possible configurations of the spins and their corresponding energies. The energy expression E = -J[S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3] can take on different values depending on the alignment of the spins. There are 8 possible configurations for three spins (S1, S2, S3), leading to different energy levels. By calculating the contributions to the partition function from each configuration, we find that the correct expression for Z is Z = 2 e^(3Jβ) + 6 e^(-Jβ), which corresponds to option A."
