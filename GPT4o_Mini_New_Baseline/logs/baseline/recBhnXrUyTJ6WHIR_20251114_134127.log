QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: You are studying a nuclear decay which converts two heavy nucleons of flavor A to another flavor B, while simultaneously emitting two much lighter particles E and V. In short, 2A -> 2B + 2E + 2V. It is known that the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles is continuous, with some endpoint value Q.

A variant of this decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. In this case, how does the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles compare to that of the original decay?

Options:
A) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint increases.
B) The spectrum remains continuous with an adjusted shape, and the endpoint decreases.
C) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint increases.
D) The spectrum becomes discrete, and the endpoint decreases.

You must respond in JSON format with the following structure:

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "A",
  "Reasoning": "In the original decay, the emission of two particles V contributes to the energy distribution of the outgoing particles E, resulting in a continuous spectrum. When one massless particle M is emitted instead of the two V particles, the total energy available for the E particles increases because the massless particle carries no energy. This leads to an adjusted shape of the spectrum while maintaining its continuity, and the endpoint increases due to the additional energy from the massless particle."
