QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: The study of quantum mechanics deals with a lot of matrices. Consider the following matrices. 

W = (0, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0), 
X = (i, -1, 2i; 1, 0, 1;  2i, -1, -i),
Y = (0.5, 0.1, 0.2; 0.1, 0.25, 0.1; 0.2, 0.1, 0.25)
Z - (3, 2i, 5; -2i, -2, -4i; 5, 4i, 4)

Note. The matrices are formatted such that each row of the matrix is separated by a semicolon.  

Based on these matrices, choose the correct statement.


Options:
A) (e^X)*Y*(e^{-X}) represents a quantum state.
B) Z and X represent observables.
C) There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.
D) W and X represent the evolution operator of some quantum system.

You must respond in JSON format with the following structure:

  "Answer": "A or B or C or D",
  "Reasoning": "your reasoning here"
}

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "C",
  "Reasoning": "In quantum mechanics, the matrix exponential e^X can change the norm of a vector if X is not Hermitian. Since X contains complex elements, it is likely that there exists a vector such that multiplying it by e^X results in a change in its norm. This aligns with the properties of non-Hermitian operators in quantum mechanics."
