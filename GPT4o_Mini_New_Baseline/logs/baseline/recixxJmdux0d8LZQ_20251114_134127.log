QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: The reaction of an electron pair donor, nucleophile (Nu) with an electron pair acceptor is called nucleophilic substitution reaction. An sp3-hybridized electrophile needs to have a leaving group to proceed with the reaction. Substitution reactions have the following two types. One is SN1 and the other is the SN2 reaction. In contrast to the substitution reaction, the elimination reaction involves the removal of a pair or groups of atoms from a molecule. These are chemical reactions in which single carbon-carbon bonded organic compounds are converted to compounds containing double/triple bonds (unsaturated compounds).
Arrange the following nucleophiles more reactive to the poorest reactive in the aqueous solution.

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

Options:
A) 5, 2, 1, 3 and 4
B) 2, 5, 1, 4 and 3
C) 5, 2, 3, 1 and 4
D) 2, 5, 3, 4 and 3

You must respond in JSON format with the following structure:
{
  "Answer": "A or B or C or D",
  "Reasoning": "your reasoning here"

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "B",
  "Reasoning": "In aqueous solution, nucleophiles are ranked based on their basicity and the stability of the resulting species after the nucleophilic attack. Hydroxide (OH-) is a strong nucleophile and is more reactive than ethanethiolate (EtS-), which is also a strong nucleophile but less basic than hydroxide. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is less reactive than both hydroxide and ethanethiolate due to steric hindrance. Propionate (C2H5COO-) is a weaker nucleophile compared to the others due to resonance stabilization, and methanol (CH3OH) is the least reactive as it is a neutral molecule. Therefore, the order of reactivity from most to least reactive is: Hydroxide (2), Ethanethiolate (5), 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate (1), Propionate (3), and Methanol (4)."
