QUESTION:
Answer this scientific question by selecting the correct option (A, B, C, or D):

Question: We have a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate, where the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 10^-2 M and the [SCN-] concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. What will be the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution? 

Options:
A) 16.9%
B) 38.1%
C) 42.3%
D) 25.6%

API RESPONSE:
{
  "Answer": "B",
  "Reasoning": "To find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species, we need to calculate the concentrations of the different cobalt complexes formed in the solution. The stability constants indicate the formation of complexes with thiocyanate ions. Given the concentrations and the stability constants, we can use the equations for complex formation to determine the distribution of cobalt species. The dithiocyanato complex corresponds to the second stability constant (β2). After calculating the concentrations of all species, we find that the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is approximately 38.1% of the total cobalt species present."
